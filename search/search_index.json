DATA 23700 introduces students to visualization design, including theoretical frameworks for reasoning about chart construction, perceptual principles, and considerations for use of color, mapping, making data interactive, and conveying uncertainty. DATA 23700 also requires students to engage various other skill sets important in data science such as technical reading and writing, data wrangling, statistical modeling, storytelling, and producing shareable, reproducible analysis notebooks.</p> <p>Completion of or placement out of DATA 11900 or CMSC 14100 is a prerequisite for taking this course. Additionally, DATA 12000 and DATA 21300 should either be completed prior to registration or taken concurrently.</p> <p>Students are expected to enter the course with solid foundations in both programming and statistical modeling. At a minimum, this means that students should be comfortable writing basic algorithms and data wrangling in Python, and students should understand the mathematics behind basic regression models. Additionally, students should be comfortable picking up new programming languages as needed for coursework (e.g., installing, setting up, and self-teaching basic syntax in R or JavaScript). Students who feel unprepared to meet these requirements may find DATA 22700 (i.e., the data visualization offering for Data Science minors) a better fit. Regardless of previous preparation, both creating graphics and working with data involve many difficulties that must be confronted with patience and perserverence, but both skills will benefit students tremendously in a wide variety of endeavors.

If a student receives a score of N or U on an assignment, they may resubmit that assignment one time for a score bump of up to one increment. In other words, a resubmission can raise a N to a S or raise a U to a N, but a resubmission cannot raise a U to a S. Thus, students should always make an earnest attempt to submit something relatively complete on time rather than missing deadlines. </p> <p>How to resubmit? Students resubmitting an assignment that at first earned a N should visit office hours prepared to present their revised work to the instructor or a TA and explain how they responded to feedback. Resubmissions that at first earned a N may not be submitted without visiting office hours. Students resubmitting an assignment that at first earned a U should send their instructor a new submission via email, in the required file format(s), within the allotted timeline (see below).</p> <p>Conditions on resubmitting: </p> <ul> <li>Students wishing to resubmit an assignment must do so within three weeks of the assignment's due date. </li> <li>The last day for resubmissions is Friday December 5, and no resubmissions will be accepted after this date.</li> <li>Students may not resubmit the same assignment more than one time.</li> <li>A score bump upon resubmission is subject to the same standards as the original round of grading, e.g., the expectation for an S is still high.

Exercises, assignments, and the project have hard due dates, which students must adhere to. These deadlines are in place to pace the workload of DATA 23700 appropriately and to provide a fair system of accountability. Please bear in mind that the grading scheme for this class (with resubmissions) is set up to absorb a reasonable amount of sub-par work. Turning in something unpolished is much better than not turning in anything at all.</p> <p>Exceptions to the no late work policy:</p> <ul> <li>Resubmissions: Students may resubmit each assignment once, within three weeks of that assignment's due date (see above). Resubmitted assignments can receive a score change of only one increment, i.e., U to N or N to S. Resubmission cannot be used for exercises or the project.</li> <li>SDS Accommodations: Students with formal disability accommodations may be entitled to extra time on assignments. </li> <li>Emergencies: If you have an emergency and feel it warrants an exception to the no late work policy, you should first be in contact with your College advisor, as the College should be aware of the emergency and ensure that any proper university or department policies are followed if needed (e.g., an injury might require Student Disability Services accommodations). Emergencies entail conditions beyond the student's control that make it infeasible for them to complete coursework on time. This policy is not intended to provide relief for failures of time management. Once students have contacted their College advisor, they should contact their instructor via email with a CC to their College advisor. Your instructor does not need to know the details of your emergency, but they do need your College advisor to confirm that your situation qualifies as an emergency. Contacting us as early as is practical given the emergency makes the process of accommodating your situation work more smoothly for everyone.

The score on a piece of work reflects the course staff's feedback on a student's level of mastery, and students should take it as an opportunity to understand areas for improvement. Students are encouraged to ask the course staff for concrete advice about how to improve submitted work. The instructor and TAs are happy to have these kinds of conversations with students, including going over your code or writing. On the other hand, we will not entertain requests to change scores because a student feels their work deserved a higher score or disagrees with the grading process.</p> <p>There is one exception to the no grade disputes policy: if a grader made a factual mistake. Please note that this only includes cases where a grader makes an erroneous statement about your code or writing in their feedback. It does not include cases where students disagree with whether something deserves to be flagged as incorrect.</p> <p>For example, suppose a student receives a piece of feedback that says \"Poor choice of encoding for data type: Student used a part-to-whole representation for non-proportion data\u201d. If the encoded data in question was actually proportion data, and the grader missed this fact (and erroneously gave you that feedback), you can ask the instructor or a TA to review this decision. Please note that, even if the feedback is amended, it may not affect the score assigned depending on how many other issues were identified in your work.</p> <p>We ask that students keep these requests brief and to the point: no more than a few sentences identifying the exact statement that the grader made and the reasons the student believes the statement was mistaken, including references to specific parts of the submitted code or writing (e.g., \u201cI said that these are proportion data in paragraph 2 of the submitted report.\u201d). Focus on laying out the facts, and nothing else. Regrade requests should be submitted through Gradescope, not via email.</p> <p>Regrade requests are distinct from assignment resubmissions (see above).</p> <p>Finally, it is also a student's responsibility to make these requests in a timely manner. Requests to review grading mistakes must be submitted no later than one week after a graded piece of work is returned to you. After that time, we will not consider any such requests.

Further, it can diminish a student's capacity for deep thinking and critical problem solving by offloading the intellectual struggle inherent to creative work. For these reasons, students are forbidden from using generative AI to complete coursework for them (e.g., pasting assignment prompts into ChatGPT, using ChatGPT to write the project). While we discourage the use of generative AI, we do not prohibit it entirely. We recognize their are legitimate uses of this technology that students may wish to practice through their coursework. Be extremely cautious when using such tools, as they have no sense of what is correct or true and may produce plausible-looking code or writing that contains errors. </p> <p>The following are the only permissible uses of generative AI:</p> <ul> <li>Students may use autocomplete tools such as CoPilot to complete individual lines of code, as long as students understand exactly what that line of code is producing.

Similarly, we will cover a handful of APIs in Python, R, and potentially JavaScript, but students may choose which of these to use for their coursework (unless instructed to use a specific tool). We may also briefly introduce graphics editing software such as Figma or Adobe Illustrator.
