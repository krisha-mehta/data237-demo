# course info
Deliverables for this course include 5 assignments and 1 final project. Additionally, there will be participation points awarded for 12 exercises and 6 in-class quizes. 

### Assignments

Assignments are summative assessments of core learning objectives in the course. Each assignment involves analyzing and visualizing a specific dataset (often provided by the instructor). Students are expected to create orginal work; collaboration or copying from any source is not allowed. Assignments are evaluated based on both the *quality of visualizations* produced as well as the *quality of write-ups* explaining the analysis and design rationale. 

Assignment 2 is distinct from the others insofar as it is a project proposal, which serves as checkpoint for whether students have a promising a feasible project idea. This is not a summative assessment but a prospective one. It provides an opportunity to workshop ideas for the project, but it offers no guarantees about the subsequent project grade. It will be treated the same as other assignments for grading and resubmission purposes.

### Project

The project serves the purpose of a final in DATA 23700. The project involves choosing and analyzing dataset and producing a written technical report about the analysis. Students are expected to create orginal work; collaboration or copying from any source is not allowed. The project is evaluated on the following criteria:

- Choice of dataset
- Quality of analysis
- Quality of visualizations
- Quality of write-up

### Participation

Participation is at the core of DATA 23700 and is weighed strongly in grading. There will be many opportunities to earn participation credit throughout the quarter, and students are expected to take these opportunities in order to keep pace with the course. Participation will be evaluated through *participation points* awarded for successfully completing exercises and being present for in-class quizes. 

Exercises are opportunities for skill-building, practice, and collaboration. Exercises begin during class time, but students may need to spend time completing them at home. Exercises usually involve a few specific tasks, including reading technical specifications, writing code, and documenting work. Exercises are evaluated on *completeness and following directions*. No partial credit will be awarded for exercises. Exercises that are late, incomplete, or which do not follow directions will not receive points.

In-class quizes serve as an attendance mechanism. They will not be announced in advance, with the exception of the syllabus quiz during our first session. Instead, they will be pop quizes for which students must attend class to receive points. Quizes will be very short and evaluated on *completeness but not correctness*. Students not present in class when a quiz is administered will not have the option to make up missed points.
